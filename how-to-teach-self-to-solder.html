	<h2>How to Teach Yourself to Solder</h2>
<img src="soldering.jpg" class="responsive-image" alt="stock image soldering to a board">
<br>
<p>The easiest way to learn how to solder is to just do it and not worry about mistakes. You WILL make mistakes. So before you try and fix something you really want fixed, I recommend starting out with “learn to solder” kits. They come with instructions on how to solder their kits as well.</p>

    <h3>Soldering is Really Easy</h3>

<br>
    <p>All you really do is heat up a pin and then add solder to the pin. This can take ~10 seconds, so be patient and keep the iron touching the pin. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND getting a soldering iron that can change the temperature. There’s many approaches to temperature. I typically go at about 800-850F on my iron and move quickly. If I’m working on something more delicate and heat-sensitive like LED strips, I use 550-650F.</p>

    <h3>De-Soldering is NOT Easy</h3>

   <p>Soldering is easy. De-soldering is REALLY hard in comparison. One way to de-solder is counter intuitive. Add a whole bunch of solder to the pins, place solder wick on top, heat up the wick with your iron until all the solder is absorbed. </p>

<p>The other more easy method (assuming what you’re removing has 2 legs/pins) is heat 1-2 legs at a time and pull from the bottom.</p>

<p>Note: this article doesn’t cover surface mount soldering. That's a bit more advanced and will be an article for a later time.</p>
